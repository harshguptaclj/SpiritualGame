          <p class="description">The modes of material nature, also known as the three gunas, are fundamental qualities or energies that are believed to pervade <br> the material world according to various philosophical and spiritual traditions, including Hinduism and the Bhagavad Gita. These <br> modes influence and shape the behavior, mindset, and consciousness of living beings. The three modes of material nature are:</p>
          
            <p>Mode of Goodness(sattva)</p>
            <p>Mode of Passion(rajas)</p>
            <p>Mode of Ignorance(tamas) </p>
          

          <p>Each mode is characterised by certain qualities and tendencies. <b>This game will check these qualities in you by
            asking some questions. <br> You just have to rate yourself on the scale of 10 on those qualities.</b> Internal algorithm will tell you that in which mode you are in currently.
          </p>
          <p><b>Note:</b> These modes are not fixed categories or personality types, but rather tendencies that influence human behavior. <br>
            Individuals may exhibit qualities from different modes at different times and can work towards transcending the modes <br> through spiritual practices and self-awareness.</p>
